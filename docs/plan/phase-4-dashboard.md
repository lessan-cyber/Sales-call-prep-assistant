# Phase 4: Dashboard and History

Users need a way to see their past preps.

*   **Step 1: The Dashboard API**
    *   **What it is:** An API endpoint that returns a list of all preps for the current user.
    *   **Your task:** Create the `GET /api/preps` endpoint on the backend. It should be paginated.

*   **Step 2: The Dashboard UI**
    *   **What it is:** The main page users see when they log in.
    *   **Your task:** Build the dashboard UI as described in the PRD, with stats and a table of recent preps. Connect this to the backend API.
