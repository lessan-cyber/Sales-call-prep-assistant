# AI Sales Call Prep Assistant: Implementation Plan

Welcome to the team! This document is your guide to building the AI Sales Call Prep Assistant from the ground up. We have a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD), but this plan will break down the work into smaller, manageable steps. Think of it as a roadmap.

Our goal is to build this project in phases, ensuring that we have a solid foundation and can test our work as we go. Don't worry about getting everything perfect on the first try. We'll follow best practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), so we'll be writing tests along the way.

## The Plan

This project is broken down into 5 phases. Each phase has its own detailed document:

*   [Phase 1: The Foundation](./phase-1-foundation.md)
*   [Phase 2: User Authentication and Profiles](./phase-2-user-management.md)
*   [Phase 3: The Core AI Pipeline](./phase-3-ai-pipeline.md)
*   [Phase 4: Dashboard and History](./phase-4-dashboard.md)
*   [Phase 5: Finishing Touches](./phase-5-finishing-touches.md)

## A Note on Testing

For each step, remember to write tests! For the backend, use `pytest`. For the frontend, use `jest` and `react-testing-library`. This will save us a lot of time in the long run.

This plan should get you started. Don't hesitate to ask questions. Let's build something great!
